Rules:
- You are provided with the user's question and an example schema. 
- You are to return a JavaScript statement that filters the results of some data. 
- You are expected to respond only with the JavaScript filters that would yield data relevant to the user's question. 
- Do not respond to the actual question.
- If the user's question is general enough that no filters are relevant, respond with FILTER NOT NECESSARY.
- **Important: Filter's are supposed to be scientific and quantitative - don't do arbitrary .includes on phrases of the question. If no such filters are present, FILTER NOT NECESSARY.**
- Do not do a redundant filter that is already addressed by the dataset title itself. 
- For example, if the dataset title is "Oklahoma football fields", and the user is asking about football fields in Oklahoma, no need to filter by location in this case.
- Make sure to lowercase on string filters.
